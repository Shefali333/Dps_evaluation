Assignment:
Create a web page for validation of passwords entered by users. The rules for a valid password are the following:
it should have the length of 8-16 symbols
it should contain letters of latin alphabet[a-zA-Z] and at least one digit[0-9]
it should not contain full english words (you can use any free dictionary API to check this)
Examples: valid passwords: hel1lo, catap2ult, invalid passwords: hello1, hell1o, cat2apult.

Technology used:
HTML, CSS, javascript


Development Environment:
1. Create a Github account & create repository with adding readme.md file extension included in list.
2. Installed Visual Studio Code for this assignment with Github Codespace development environment.
3. Created GitHub Repository with the name Dps_evaluation and cloned with Visual Studio codespace.
4. Add html,css and js files to root folder of repository workspace.

Software used:
Github CodeSpace with Visual Studio Code : 
(What is a codespace- A codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud. We can commit configuration files tot the repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a
repeatable codespace configuration for all users of the project)

Github as version Control:
I installed Git which is the most used version control system and has unique features like the 'add' command, remote repositories, branching, merging, and pull requests that enhance team collaboration and workflow allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. 
A Git repository (or repo) holds all the project files and their entire revision history, making it easier to track changes. 

To use the password validation code, follow these steps:

1. Include the JavaScript code in your project.
2. Ensure you have the required HTML structure.
3. Customize the file paths for CSS and icon resources, if necessary.
4. Add the LiveServer extension in Visual Studio and launch local host server.
5. Run your project and test the password validation by typing in the password field in the local host server.

File Structure:-

index.html: The HTML file containing the password input field and requirements list.
style.css: The CSS file containing styles for the HTML elements.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the password validation code.
